# GroovyOpenMeetingsClient

A partially (very partial) implemented REST client, using JAXB and Groovy, for interacting
with [Apache OpenMeetings](http://openmeetings.apache.org/) using the [REST API](http://openmeetings.apache.org/openmeetings-webservice/apidocs/index.html).

This has a very small subset of the API currently implemented, although we hope to reach 100% eventually.  Patches and
pull requests are, of course, welcome.
